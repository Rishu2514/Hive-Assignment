Q-6-Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
A-6-from sales_order_csv insert overwrite table sales_order_orc select *;
set hive.cli.print.header = true;


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
ANS-select year_id,sum(sales) as total_sales_per_year from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
ANS-
select SUM(QUANTITYORDERED) as Total_Qantity,PRODUCTLINE as Max_order_Product from sales_order_orc group by PRODUCTLINE order by
Total_Qantity desc limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
ANS-select QTR_ID,sum(SALES) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by QTR_ID;


d. In which quarter sales was minimum
ANS-select QTR_ID,sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by QTR_ID order by total_sales limit 1;


e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
ANS-
select COUNTRY,sum(SALES) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by COUNTRY order by total_sales desc limit 1
union all
select COUNTRY,sum(SALES) as total_sales from sales_order_orc group by COUNTRY order by total_sales limit 1;


f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
ANS-select CITY,QTR_ID,sum(SALES) as quaterly_sales from sales_order_orc group by CITY,QTR_ID;


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
ANS-
select year,month from(select year_id as year,month_id as month,sum(quantityordered) as total_quantity,dense_rank() over(partition by 
year_id order by sum(quantityordered) desc) as r from sales_order_orc group by year_id,month_id)tab where r=1;
